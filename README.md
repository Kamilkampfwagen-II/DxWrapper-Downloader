# DxWrapper-Downloader
A powershell script for downloading nightly builds from [elishacloud/dxwrapper](https://github.com/elishacloud/dxwrapper) with ease!

*Don't mind the `.bat` extension, this is a Powershell script. This script makes use of [PS-BAT](https://github.com/Kamilkampfwagen-II/PS-BAT), which is makes it more convenient than using terminal or a separate batch file to run the script.*
